The **International Conference on Probabilistic Numerics** (**ProbNum**) is a gathering of researchers working on algorithms that quantify or utilize **computational uncertainty**, i.e. the error arising when a mathematical task is performed on a discrete computer in finite time. 

Of particular interest are numerical algorithms for use within **machine learning**; **artificial intelligence**; **scientific simulation**, and **computational statistics**, due to these communities' innate interest in **uncertainty quantification**. 

The goal of the conference is an open exchange of ideas, aiming to embrace computational uncertainty to make **computations** **faster**, **more reliable**, and **easier to design and use**. 

### Dates and Venue 

ProbNum25 will be held at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) in [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) near Nice, France, from **1-3 September 2025**.

### Registration
The event is open to all. We expect to open registrations on **14th May 2025**.

### Proceedings and Call for Papers
As our community grows, we are moving towards a broader conference format: ProbNum25 will have **proceedings**; you can find more details about this [here](/submissions.html).

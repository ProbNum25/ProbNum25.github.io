    <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
    <p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators—specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation—both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, potentially resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance. To address this, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p>
